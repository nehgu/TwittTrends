# Objectives
	•	Use the Amazon SQS service to create a processing queue for the Tweets that are delivered by the Twitter Streaming API
	•	Use Amazon SNS service to update the status processing on each tweet so the UI can refresh.
	•	Integrate a third party cloud service API into the Tweet processing flow.

# Overview
![Architecture](/ouIDUJT.png)
Streaming

	•	Reads a stream of tweets from the Twitter Streaming API. Note: you might follow a set of specific keywords that you find interesting
	•	After fetching a new tweet, check to see if it has geolocation info and is in English.
	•	Once the tweet validates these filters, send a message to SQS for asynchronous processing on the text of the tweet

Worker

	•	Define a worker pool that will pick up messages from the queue to process. These workers should each run on a separate pool thread.
	•	Make a call to the sentiment API off your preference (e.g. Alchemy). This can return a positive, negative or neutral sentiment evaluation for the text of the submitted Tweet.
	•	As soon as the tweet is processed send a notification -using SNS- to an HTTP endpoint that contains the information about the tweet.
  
Backend

	•	On receiving the notification, index this tweet in Elasticsearch. Make sure you preserve the sentiment of the tweet as well.
	•	The backend should provide the functionality to the user to search for tweets that match a particular keyword. To this end, you can either write a new webserver or simply reuse your first assignment.

Frontend

	•	When a new tweet is indexed, provide some visual indication on the frontend. 
	•	Give the user the ability to search your index via a free text input or a dropdown.
	•	Plot the tweets that match the query on a map.
